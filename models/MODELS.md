## Model Types Explained
- **Multilingual LLM:** General-purpose Large Language Models trained on many languages (e.g., Aya, Orion). They are good at understanding context but are not exclusively built for translation.
- **Instruct LLM:** A general-purpose LLM that has been fine-tuned to be good at following user commands or "instructions." Their translation ability varies.
- **Translations / Ro-Translations:** Models designed and trained specifically for translation tasks, either between many languages (Translations) or focused on Romanian (Ro-Translations).
- **Bilingual Ro-En:** Foundation models trained extensively on both Romanian and English, making them highly effective for translation between the two.
- **Multimodal:** Models that can process more than one type of data, such as both text and audio (e.g., SeamlessM4T).
- **OPUS / Transformer-align:** Architectures that are highly effective for translation. OPUS is a popular framework, and many models are built on it, sometimes with community fine-tuning.
